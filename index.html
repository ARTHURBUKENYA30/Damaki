<h2>Sanctuaries in Uganda </h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are different sanctuaries in Uganda where different animal species are brought in order to protect them and increase their numbers. The sanctuaries in Uganda are doing a great job of conserving different animal species for instance the endangered <strong>white rhinos</strong> and a number of other animals which are protected for the rest of their lives however under different circumstances for instance if the numbers have increased they can reintroduce them to areas where they once lived or to different protected areas they have never been.  Some of the sanctuaries in Uganda include the following which can be visited by the tourist on their<strong> Safaris Uganda tour</strong>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b><img class="alignleft" style="border: 1px solid #ddd; /* gray border */ border-radius: 4px; /* rounded border */ padding: 5px; /* some padding */ width: 250px; height: 165px;" src="images/Ziwa-Rhino-SanctuarY.jpg">Ziwa Rhino Sanctuary: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ziwa rhino sanctuary is located in Nakasongola district; the rhino sanctuary was established to protect the endangered white rhinos in the country and the country. In Uganda, the numbers of white rhinos dramatically dropped during the civil war that happened during the era of Idi Amin this prompted establishment of the rhino sanctuary. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is important to note that in Uganda for a tourist interested to participate in rhino tracking, the sanctuary will offer the best experience and it is the only place where it can be carried out because of the many numbers that can be found. Another place where the rhinos can be found in the whole country is the Uganda wildlife education centre where only two rhinos can be found therefore the<strong> Ziwa rhino sanctuary</strong> is the best place to be when you’re interested in seeing and tracking the rhinos.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the sanctuary, a tourist can carry out a number of activities which is quite an interesting affair for instance birding can be carried out because there is a swamp within the sanctuary which makes it home to a number of birds for example </span>Abdim's Stork, Blue-spotted Abyssinian Ground Hornbill, Booted eagle, African Black Crake, Broad-billed Roller, African Black-headed Oriole, Bronze Manikini<span style="font-weight: 400;"> among other bird species.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">And also important to note among the bird species is the interesting shoe bill which is considered a critically endangered bird species that can be seen in the swamp. The sanctuary has achieved some success Ziwa has had quite the success. Ten calves have born (although sadly, one was still-born) and there are five crashes living in the sanctuary alongside bushbuck, leopard, honey badgers, armadillos, waterbuck, warthog, and vervet monkeys.</span></p>
